# Scratch Triage

There should be nothing in this directory except for this `.README.md` file. This filename
starts with a dot so that `sfdx` ignores it when pushing or pulling from the scratch org.

The `scratch/triage` folder is the "inbox" for new metadata created in the scratch org. Running
`sfdx force:source:pull` will land new metadata in this directory. From here it needs to be
determined whether the files are part of the code delivered to the client (`client-app`), or if it
is not important to commit to git (i.e. you will delete it from here when no longer needed for the
current task at hand), or whether it should be relocated to `scratch/client-dev-config` since
it will be useful for other developers spinning up a scratch org for this client (e.g. a Named
Credential for the client's SAP instance, or a Flexipage that makes it easy to interact with a
client's custom component).
